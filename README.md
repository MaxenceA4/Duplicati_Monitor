   git clone https://github.com/MaxenceA4/Duplicati_Monitor
   cd project-repo
   ```
   
2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Create a MySQL database and import the `duplicati_monitoring.sql` file to set up the necessary tables.
   - Modify the `LoginConnection/connection.php` file with your database credentials (username, password, database name, etc.).

3. **Place the Files:**
   - Place the entire contents of the `project-repo` directory into the root of your web server or in a subdirectory.

4. **Configure Duplicati:**

   - Modify the `send-http-result-output-format` to `Json`
   - Modify the `send-http-message` to `Duplicati Backup Report\n\nOperation: %OPERATIONNAME%\nResult: %PARSEDRESULT%\nDate: %DATE%\nDetails: %DETAILS%`

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://yourserver/path_to_project/index.php` to view the backup reports.

## Notes
The wheel of cheese circular progress bars are controlled by the percentage of backups found in the last 24 hours and 7 days. This percentage is calculated based on the total number of backup reports found. <br>
You can modify the time intervals for the backup reports by changing the SQL queries in the index.php file.
